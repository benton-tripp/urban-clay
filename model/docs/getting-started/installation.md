# Installation

## Cloud Environments

Launch into a [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io) environment on

| [Binder](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest) | [SageMaker Studio Lab](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws) |

| [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Clay-foundation/model/main) | [![Open in SageMaker Studio Lab](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/studiolab.svg)](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/import/github/Clay-foundation/model/blob/main/docs/tutorials/clay-v1-wall-to-wall.ipynb) |

## Local Environments

Start by cloning this [repo-url](https://github.com/Clay-foundation/model)

    git clone https://github.com/Clay-foundation/model
    cd model

Then we recommend [using mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html)
to install the dependencies. A virtual environment will also be created with Python and
[JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) installed.

    mamba env create --file environment.yml

```{note}
The command above will only work for Linux devices with CUDA GPUs. For installation
on macOS devices (either Intel or ARM chips), follow the 'Advanced' section below.
```

Activate the virtual environment first.

    mamba activate claymodel

Finally, double-check that the libraries have been installed.

    mamba list

## Advanced

This is for those who want full reproducibility of the virtual environment.
Create a virtual environment with just Python and conda-lock installed first.

    mamba create --name claymodel python=3.11 conda-lock=2.5.6
    mamba activate claymodel

Installing/Updating a virtual environment from a lockile. Use this to sync your
dependencies to the exact versions in the `conda-lock.yml` file.

    conda-lock install --mamba --name claymodel conda-lock.yml

See also https://conda.github.io/conda-lock/output/#unified-lockfile for more
usage details.

```{note}
To generate a unified [`conda-lock.yml`](https://github.com/conda/conda-lock) file
based on the dependency specification in `environment.yml`, run:

    conda-lock lock --mamba --file environment.yml --with-cuda=12.0

Use this only when creating a new `conda-lock.yml` file or refreshing an existing one.
```
